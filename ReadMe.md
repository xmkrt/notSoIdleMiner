A few notes:
- For testing purposes Leveling does not cost anything. Level via blue "buttons"
- The green sprite adds a new shaft, until it is maxed at 16. Also no costs
- The white sprites are the managers. They only automate the workflow, no other functionality. Red when active
- I wanted to add a basic menu for showing stats etc. but didn´t get to it
- I considered using decimals for the cashflow because floats are pretty inaccurate. I guess for this purpose it doesn´t matter
